What is `superblockify`?
========================

`superblockify` is a Python package for partitioning an urban street network into
Superblock-like neighborhoods and for visualizing and analyzing the partition results. A
Superblock is a set of adjacent urban blocks where vehicular through traffic is
prevented or pacified, giving priority to people walking and cycling.

Setup and use
=============

To set up superblockify, see the `Installation <installation>`__ page.
To use superblockify, the `Usage <usage>`__ page
is a good place to start.
More on the details of the inner workings can be found on
the `Reference pages <guide>`__.
Furthermore, you can also find the `API documentation <api/index.html>`__.

Statement of Need
=================

`superblockify` is designed to address the need for an open, general-use, and extendable software package for Superblock delineation, visualization, and analysis. The Superblock model is an urban planning intervention that creates more liveable and sustainable cities by forming human-centric neighborhoods with reduced vehicular traffic. However, the planning and implementation of Superblocks is a complex process that requires extensive stakeholder involvement and careful consideration of trade-offs.

With the advent of new computational tools and datasets, there is an opportunity to simplify this process by allowing for easy computational analysis and visualization of urban street networks. `superblockify` seizes this opportunity, filling a gap in the current landscape of research efforts.

The target audience for `superblockify` includes urban planners, researchers in urban studies, data scientists interested in urban data, and policymakers involved in urban development. By providing a tool for Superblock analysis, `superblockify` aims to support these professionals in their work towards creating safer, quieter, and more environmentally friendly urban environments.
