What is `superblockify`?
========================

`superblockify` is a Python package for partitioning an urban street network into
Superblock-like neighborhoods and for visualizing and analyzing the partition results. A
Superblock is a set of adjacent urban blocks where vehicular through traffic is
prevented or pacified, giving priority to people walking and cycling.
