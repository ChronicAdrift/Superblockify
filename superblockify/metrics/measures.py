        The edge attribute to use as weight to decide which multi-edge to attribute the

    attr_suffix : str, optional
        The suffix to append to the attribute names, by default None
    k : int, optional
        The number of nodes to calculate the betweenness centrality for, by default
        None
    seed : int, random_state, or None (default)

    ValueError
        If weight is not None and the graph does not have the weight attribute on all

    Notes
    -----
    Works in-place on the graph.

    Does not include endpoints.

    Modified from :mod:`networkx.algorithms.centrality.betweenness`.

    The :attr:`weight` attribute is not used to determine the shortest paths, these are
    taken from the predecessors matrix. It is only used for parallel edges, to decide
    which edge to attribute the betweenness centrality to.

    If there are <= 2 nodes, node betweenness is 0 for all nodes. If there are <= 1
    edges, edge betweenness is 0 for all edges.

    Notes
    -----
    The edges_u and edges_v arrays are sorted together, this way indices can be
    found using a binary search. This is faster than using np.where.
